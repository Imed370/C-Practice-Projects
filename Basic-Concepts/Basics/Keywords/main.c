    */

    //Storage Type Keywords
    /*
        auto 	    Lifetime of the variable is limited to the block its declared in (default)
        extern 	    Declares a variable or function that is defined in another file
        static 	    Indicates that a variable retains its value between function calls
    
    */

    //Conditional Keywords
    /*
        goto 	    Jumps to a labeled statement
        if 	        Starts an if statement

    */

    //Other Keywords
    /*
        const 	    Specifies a constant value
        Sizeof 	    Determines the size of a data type
        Volatile 	tells the compiler that it should always read the value
                    of the variable from its memory location, rather than
                    using a cached or optimized value. (used for MMIO, or
                    variables mapped to HardWare Registers)
        _Atomic	    Specifies that a type or variable is atomic, meaning it can be accessed concurrently. (C11)
